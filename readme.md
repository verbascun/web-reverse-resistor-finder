# Goal of this app is to find an odd valued resistor thru joining other resistors in different configuration.

## How to use?
All you have to do is enter desired resistor value and calculator will show you how to obtain this resistance using 2 resistors in parallel or series configuration.
Top of each table is always showing the closest value.
